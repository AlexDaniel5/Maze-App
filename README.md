### Description
Descritpion: The program generates a maze using Turtle's graphics library to visually represent and solve a
maze using the Breadth-First Search algorithm. The maze is defined by a grid of characters, where '+' represents
walls, 's' represents the starting point, 'e' represents the endpoint, and spaces represent open paths. The
Breadth-First Search algorithm is implemented to explore the maze and find the shortest path from the starting
point to the endpoint. The resulting solution is visually displayed on the screen with a yellow path.

### Notes
- init stands for initial state of the object
- list appends need to be double braced or the compiler complains that more than one arguement is given
